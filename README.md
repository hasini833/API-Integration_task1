## 📁 Project Structure


📦 api-integration-dashboard/
├── index.html         # Main application file
└── README.md          # Project documentation

No frameworks or build tools are used. Just open `index.html` directly in your browser.


## ⚙️ How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/api-integration-dashboard.git
cd api-integration-dashboard
````

### 2. Open the File

Open `index.html` in any modern browser:

```bash
start index.html
```

You’ll see two main sections:

* **Weather Information** with temperature, humidity, and more
* **Latest News** articles from top sources

## 🔑 Set Your API Keys

To make the project fully functional:

* Sign up and get a free API key from:

  * [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
  * [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org)

* Then replace the `"demo"` keys in the script section:

```js
// Replace with your keys
const weatherApiKey = 'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_KEY';
const newsApiKey = 'YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY';
```

Without valid keys, the app will fall back to mock data for display purposes.
